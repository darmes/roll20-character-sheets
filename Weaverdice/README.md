# Character sheet for WeaverDice
*based on the superhero webserial Worm by John C. "Wildbow" McCrae*

Any improvements to the sheet are welcome.



### Version 1.2:

- skill rolls added, with minor options

- expand skill descriptions to 6 rows

- change default stat modifier to zero, as is the baseline for PCs

### Version 1.0:

- fix Health tracker, doesn't reset any more

- added "Stat modifier" lable over stat placement, for clarity

- made "notes" textfields in gear& other repeating sections wider

- made most large textboxes smaller

- some visual corrections

- code cleanup, removed duplicate code& some renaming

### Version 0.9:

- basic stat tracking capabilities, dynamicly expanding sections for gear and other lists

- stats can be rolled directly from the sheet

- Cape name moved to be in more in the center

- no help yet with character creation rolls yet

- buttons to roll for skills have not been implemented, as the way skills improve in WD is complex to implement

## Possible future improvements:

- implement all skill options

- create power-generation and luck tables so character creation can be made quicker in Roll20

- make the layout more flexible to resizing, it's still quite crude atm
